This lab focuses on Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions and Continuous Delivery (CD) or deployment, specifically utilizing Heroku.

## Functionality

1. Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions
2. Continuous Delivery (Deployment) with Heroku

### Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions

1. Create a CI workflow for the Node.js using this [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/building-and-testing-nodejs).
2. Improve the Workflow to connect Node.js application to Redis
3. Practice a regular workflow of the software development life cycle

### Continuous Delivery (Deployment) with Heroku

1. Create an account on [Heroku](https://heroku.com)
2. Create an app on [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/new-app) and configure it.
3. Add Redis service to Heroku deployment - https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-redis
4. Configure the workflow to deploy to Heroku using [this guide](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-heroku).
5. Practice a regular workflow of the software development life cycle like in Part 2.
